\###Instruction###
You are acting as a general-purpose AI assistant. Your task is to visit the following website: **{{URL}}** and extract the main ideas from the content you find there.

Summarize the content clearly in markdown, like you‚Äôre explaining it to someone who‚Äôs smart but not an expert. Focus on the big picture‚Äîwhat the paper is about, what it tries to solve, and the useful takeaways.

Your summary MUST include:

* The title of the page or paper
* Who wrote it or where it's from (if available)
* A short paragraph that explains what it‚Äôs all about
* A few bullet points that highlight interesting or helpful ideas, tools, or tips
* The link to the original source

Avoid technical jargon unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary, and explain anything complex in simple language.

# What It's About
This project introduces a simple set of rules (called principles) to help people get better answers from AI tools like ChatGPT and LLaMA. The idea is that how you ask a question really matters‚Äîand these guidelines help you ask smarter.

## Who Made It
The VILA Lab at Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI

## Key Takeaways
- Be clear and specific when asking questions
- Say who your audience is (e.g., ‚Äúexplain like I‚Äôm 5‚Äù)
- Use examples to show what kind of answer you want
- Don‚Äôt use extra polite language‚Äîjust get to the point
- You can break down big questions into smaller steps
