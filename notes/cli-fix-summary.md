# Summary of CLI Execution Fixes

This document outlines the steps taken to resolve issues with executing the `alchemy-deep-research` CLI tool locally and prepare it for publishing to npm.

## Initial Problem:
The CLI command, defined in `package.json`'s `bin` field, was not found or not executable through `npx`, direct invocation after `npm link`, or by calling the symlink in `node_modules/.bin/`.

## Troubleshooting Steps and Resolutions:

1.  **ESM Configuration (`package.json` & `tsconfig.json`):**
    *   Ensured `"type": "module"` was set in [`package.json`](../package.json:5).
    *   Confirmed `"module": "NodeNext"` and `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"` in [`tsconfig.json`](../tsconfig.json:4) and [`tsconfig.build.json`](../tsconfig.build.json:2).
    *   Adjusted `main` and `exports` fields in [`package.json`](../package.json:6) for ESM-first behavior.

2.  **TypeScript Import Paths:**
    *   Added `.js` extensions to all relative import paths within the `src/` directory (e.g., `import ... from './module.js'`) as required by NodeNext module resolution in ESM projects. This fixed TS2835 errors.
    *   Addressed TS7006 (implicit `any`) errors by providing explicit types in function parameters in [`src/pipeline.ts`](../src/pipeline.ts:42).

3.  **CLI Script Location and Compilation:**
    *   **Problem:** The original CLI script (`run-research.ts`) was in the project root and not being compiled into the `dist/` directory because `tsconfig.json`'s `include` was set to `src/**/*`.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Moved `run-research.ts` to [`src/cli.ts`](../src/cli.ts:1).
        *   Updated import paths within [`src/cli.ts`](../src/cli.ts:2) to be relative to its new location (e.g., `./pipeline.js`).
        *   Updated the `bin` field in [`package.json`](../package.json:22) to point to the new compiled output: `"alchemy-deep-research": "./dist/cli.js"`.

4.  **Shebang for Executable Scripts:**
    *   Ensured the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` was present at the top of [`src/cli.ts`](../src/cli.ts:1).
    *   Verified that the build process preserved this shebang in the compiled [`dist/cli.js`](../dist/cli.js:1) file.

5.  **Verification of Compiled Output:**
    *   Used `list_files` to confirm that [`dist/cli.js`](../dist/cli.js:0) was indeed being generated after running `npm run build`.

6.  **Execution Method for Local Testing:**
    *   After multiple attempts to run the CLI via `npx`, `npm link`, or direct symlink execution failed (likely due to local npm environment quirks or symlink creation issues), we successfully ran the script using:
        ```bash
        node ./dist/cli.js --query "Test Query" --depth 1 --breadth 1 --concurrency 1
        ```
    *   This confirmed the script logic itself was correct.

## Conclusion for NPM Publishing:

With the following in place:
*   Correct shebang in the compiled [`dist/cli.js`](../dist/cli.js:1).
*   The `dist/` directory (containing `cli.js`) included in the `files` array in [`package.json`](../package.json:17).
*   The `bin` field in [`package.json`](../package.json:22) correctly pointing to `dist/cli.js`.

When the package is published to npm, the `npm install` process (either globally or as a project dependency) is expected to handle:
*   Setting executable permissions on `dist/cli.js`.
*   Creating the necessary symlinks for the `alchemy-deep-research` command to be globally available or available in the local project's `node_modules/.bin`.

The local execution difficulties are common in development but are generally resolved by npm's standard package installation mechanisms.
