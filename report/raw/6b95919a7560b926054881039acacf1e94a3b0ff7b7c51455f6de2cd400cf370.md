###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information, allowing humans to retain experiences, knowledge, skills, and facts over time, and serving as the foundation for growth and effective interaction with the world. It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions, learning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to changes.
In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the ability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past interactions to improve future responses and interactions.
Although previous research and reviews have provided detailed descriptions of memory mechanisms, there is still a lack of a systematic review that summarizes and analyzes the relationship between the memory of LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, as well as how we can be inspired by human memory to construct more powerful memory systems.
To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory of LLM-driven AI systems.
In particular, we first conduct a detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the memory of AI systems.
Second, we systematically organize existing memory-related work and propose a categorization method based on three dimensions (object, form, and time) and eight quadrants.
Finally, we illustrate some open problems regarding the memory of current AI systems and outline possible future directions for memory in the era of large language models.

## 1 Introduction

Report issue for preceding element

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become the core component of AI systems due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, and are widely used in various applications such as intelligent customer service, automated writing, machine translation, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib1 ""), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib2 ""), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib3 ""), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib4 "")\].
Unlike traditional AI systems, which rely on predefined rules and manually labeled features, LLM-driven AI systems offer greater flexibility, handling a diverse range of tasks with enhanced adaptability and contextual awareness.
Moreover, the introduction of memory enables LLMs to retain historical interactions with users and store contextual information, thereby providing more personalized, continuous, and context-aware responses in future interactions \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib2 ""), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib5 ""), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib6 "")\].
AI systems powered by LLMs with memory capabilities will not only elevate the user experience but also support more complex and dynamic use cases, steering AI technology toward greater intelligence and human-centric design \[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib7 ""), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib8 "")\].

In neuroscience, human memory refers to the brain’s ability to store, retain, and recall information \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib9 ""), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib10 "")\].
Human memory serves as the foundation for understanding the world, learning new knowledge, adapting to the environment, and making decisions, allowing us to preserve past experiences, skills, and knowledge, and helping us form our personal identity and behavior patterns \[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib11 "")\].
Human memory can be broadly classified into short-term memory and long-term memory based on the duration of new memory formation \[ [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib12 "")\].
Short-term memory refers to the information we temporarily store and process, typically lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, and includes sensory memory and working memory \[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib11 "")\].
Long-term memory refers to the information we can store for extended periods, ranging from minutes to years, and includes declarative explicit memory (such as episodic and semantic memory) and non-declarative implicit memory (such as conditioned reflexes and procedural memory) \[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib11 "")\].
Human memory is a complex and dynamic process that relies on different memory systems to process information for various purposes, influencing how we understand and respond to the world.
The different types of human memory and their working mechanisms can greatly inspire us to develop more scientific and reasonable memory-enhanced AI systems \[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib13 ""), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib14 ""), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib15 ""), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib16 "")\].

In the era of large language models (LLMs), the most typical memory-enhanced AI system is the LLM-powered autonomous agent system \[ [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib10 "")\].
Large language model (LLM) powered agents are AI systems that can perform complex tasks using natural language, incorporating capabilities like planning, tool use, memory, and multi-step reasoning to enhance interactions and problem-solving \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib1 ""), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib2 ""), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib10 "")\].
This memory-enhanced AI system is capable of autonomously decomposing complex tasks, remembering interaction history, and invoking and executing tools, thereby efficiently completing a series of intricate tasks.
In particular, memory, as a key component of the LLM-powered agent, can be defined as the process of acquiring, storing, retaining, and subsequently retrieving information \[ [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib10 "")\].
It enables the large language model to overcome the limitation of LLM’s context window, allowing the agent to recall interaction history and make more accurate and intelligent decisions.
For instance, MemoryBank \[ [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib17 "")\] proposed a long-term memory mechanism to allow LLMs for retrieving relevant memories, continuously evolving through continuous updates, and understanding and adapting to a user’s personality by integrating information from previous interactions.
In addition, many commercial and open-source AI systems have also integrated memory systems to enhance the personalization capabilities of the system, such as OpenAI ChatGPT Memory \[ [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib18 "")\], Apple Personal Context \[ [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib19 "")\], mem0 \[ [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib20 "")\], MemoryScope \[ [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib21 "")\], etc.

Although previous studies and reviews have provided detailed explanations of memory mechanisms, most of the existing work focuses on analyzing and explaining memory from the temporal (time) dimension, specifically in terms of short-term and long-term memory \[ [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib8 ""), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib7 ""), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib17 "")\].
We believe that categorizing memory solely based on the time dimension is insufficient, as there are many other aspects (such as object and form) to memory classification in AI systems.
For example, from the object dimension, since AI systems often interact with humans, they need to perceive, store, recall, and use memories related to individual users, thus generating personal memory. Meanwhile, when AI systems perform complex tasks, they generate intermediate results (such as reasoning and planning processes, internet search results, etc.), which form system memory.
In addition, from the form dimension, since AI systems are powered by large language models (LLMs), they can store memories through the parametric memory encoded within the model parameters, as well as through non-parametric memory in the form of external memory documents that are stored and managed outside the model.
Therefore, insights that consider memory from the perspectives of object (personal and system), form (parametric and non-parametric), and time (short-term and long-term) are still lacking in the current era of large language models.
There is still no comprehensive review that systematically analyzes the relationship between memory in LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, and how insights from human memory can be leveraged to build more efficient and powerful memory systems.

To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the memory mechanisms in LLM-driven AI systems.
First, we provide a detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the memory systems in AI.
In particular, we explore how human memory types — short-term memory (including sensory memory and working memory) and long-term memory (including explicit memory and implicit memory) — correspond to personal and system memory, parametric and non-parametric memory, and short-term and long-term memory in LLM-driven AI systems.
Next, we systematically organize the existing work related to memory and propose a classification method based on three dimensions (object, form, and time) with eight quadrants.
In the object dimension, memory can be divided into personal memory and system memory; in the form dimension, it can be classified into parametric memory and non-parametric memory; in the time dimension, memory can be categorized into short-term memory and long-term memory.
Finally, based on the classification results from the three dimensions and eight quadrants mentioned above, we analyze some open issues in the memory of current AI systems and outline potential future directions for memory development in the era of large language models.

## 2 Overview

Report issue for preceding element

The human brain has evolved complex yet efficient memory mechanisms over a long period, enabling it to encode, store, and recall information effectively \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib9 "")\].
Accordingly, in the development of AI systems, we can draw insights from human memory to design effective & efficient memory mechanisms or systems.
In this section, we will first describe in detail the complex memory mechanisms and related memory systems of the human brain from the perspective of memory neuroscience.
Then, we will discuss the memory mechanisms and types specific to LLM-driven AI systems.
Finally, based on the memory features of LLM-driven AI systems, we will systematically review and categorize existing work from different dimensions.

### 2.1 Human Memory

Report issue for preceding element

Human memory typically relies on different memory systems to process information for various purposes, such as working memory for temporarily storing and processing information to support ongoing cognitive activities, and episodic memory for recording personal experiences and events for a long time \[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib11 "")\].

#### 2.1.1 Short-Term and Long-Term Memory

Report issue for preceding element

Based on the time range, human memory can be roughly divided into short-term memory and long-term memory according to the well-known Multi-Store Model (or Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model) \[ [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.15965v1#bib.bib22 "")\].

##### Short-Term Memory

Report issue for preceding element

Short-term memory is a temporary storage system that holds small amounts of information for brief periods, typically ranging from seconds to minutes.
It includes sensory memory, which briefly captures raw sensory information from the environment (like sights or sounds), and working memory, which actively processes and manipulates information to complete tasks such as problem-solving or learning.
Together, these components allow humans to temporarily hold and work with information before either discarding it or transferring it to long-term memory.

Sensory memory: Sensory memory is the brief storage of sensory information we acquire from the external world, including iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), haptic memory (touch), and other sensory data. It typically lasts only a few milliseconds to a few seconds. Some sensory memories are transferred to working memory, while others are eventually stored in long-term memory (such as episodic memory).

Working memory: Working memory is the system we use to temporarily store and process information. It not only helps us maintain current thoughts but also plays a role in decision-making and problem-solving. For example, when solving a math problem, it allows us to keep track of both the problem and the steps involved in finding the solution.

##### Long-Term Memory

Report issue for preceding element

Long-term memory is a storage system that holds information for extended periods, ranging from minutes to a lifetime.
It includes explicit memory, which involves conscious recall of facts and events, and implicit memory, which involves unconscious skills and habits, like riding a bike.
These two types work together to help humans retain knowledge, experiences, and learned abilities over time.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Explicit memory: Explicit memory, also known as declarative memory, refers to memories that we can easily verbalize or declare. It can be further divided into episodic memory and semantic memory. Episodic memory refers to memories related to personal experiences and events, such as what you had for lunch. This type of memory is typically broken down into stages like encoding, storage, and retrieval. Semantic memory, on the other hand, refers to memories related to facts and knowledge, such as knowing that the Earth is round or that the Earth orbits the Sun.

- •


Implicit memory: Implicit memory, also known as non-declarative memory, refers to memories that are difficult to describe in words. It is associated with habits, skills, and procedures, and does not require conscious recall. Procedural memory (or "muscle memory") is a typical form of implicit memory. It refers to memories gained through actions, such as riding a bicycle or playing the piano. The planning and coordination of movements are key components of procedural memory.

Report issue for preceding element


Multiple memory systems typically operate simultaneously, storing information in various ways across different brain regions. These memory systems are not completely independent; they interact with each other and, in many cases, depend on one another.
For example, when you hear a new song, the sensory memory in your ears and the brain regions responsible for processing sound will become active, storing the sound of the song for a few seconds. This sound is then transferred to your working memory system.
As you use your working memory and consciously think about the song, your episodic memory will automatically activate, recalling where you heard the song and what you were doing at the time.
As you hear the song in different places and at different times, a new semantic memory gradually forms, linking the melody of the song with its title. So, when you hear the song again, you’ll remember the song’s title, rather than a specific instance from your multiple listening experiences.
When you practice playing the song on the guitar, your procedural memory will remember the finger movements involved in playing the song.

#### 2.1.2 Memory Mechanisms

Report issue for preceding element

Memory is the ability to encode, store and recall information.
The three main processes involved in human memory are therefore encoding (the process of acquiring and processing information into a form that can be stored), storage (the retention of encoded information over time in short-term or long-term memory), and retrieval (recall, the process of accessing and bringing stored information back into conscious awareness when needed).

Report issue for preceding element

Encoding Memory encoding is the process of changing sensory information into a form that our brain can cope with and store effectively. In particular, there are different types of encoding in terms of how information is processed, such as visual encoding, which involves processing information based on its visual features like color, shape, or texture; acoustic encoding, which focuses on the auditory characteristics of information, such as pitch, tone, or rhythm; and semantic encoding, which is based on the meaning of the information, making it easier to structure and remember. In addition, there are many approaches to make our brain better at encoding memory, such as mnemonics, which involve using acronyms or peg-word systems to aid recall, chunking, where information is broken down into smaller, meaningful units to enhance retention, imagination, which strengthens encoding by linking images to words, and association, where new information is connected to prior knowledge to improve understanding and long-term memory storage.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Storage The storage of memory involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions, with key areas including: the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with working memory and decision-making, helping us maintain and process information in the short term; the hippocampus, which helps organize and consolidate information to form new explicit memories (such as episodic memory); the cerebral cortex, which is involved in the storage and retrieval of semantic memory, allowing us to retain facts, concepts, and general knowledge over time; and the cerebellum, which is primarily responsible for procedural memory formed through repetition.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Retrieval Memory retrieval is the ability to access information and get it out of the memory storage. When we recall something, the brain reactivates neural pathways (also called synapses) linked to that memory. The prefrontal cortex helps in bringing memories back to awareness. Similarly, there are different types of memory retrieval, including recognition, where we identify previously encountered information or stimuli, such as recognizing a familiar face or a fact we have learned before; recall, which is the ability to retrieve information from memory without external cues, like remembering a phone number or address from memory; and relearning, a process in which we reacquire previously learned but forgotten information, often at a faster pace than initial learning due to the residual memory traces that still exist.

Report issue for preceding element


In addition to the fundamental memory processing stages of encoding, storage, and retrieval, human memory also includes consolidation (the process of stabilizing and strengthening memories to facilitate long-term storage), reconsolidation (the modification or updating of previously stored memories when they are reactivated, allowing them to adapt to new information or contexts), reflection (the active review and evaluation of one’s memories to enhance self-awareness, improve learning strategies, and optimize decision-making), and forgetting (the process by which information becomes inaccessible).

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Consolidation Memory consolidation refers to the process of converting short-term memory into long-term memory, allowing information to be stably stored in the brain and reducing the likelihood of forgetting. It primarily involves the hippocampus and strengthens neural connections through synaptic plasticity (strengthening of connections between neurons) and systems consolidation (the gradual transfer and reorganization of memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage).

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Reconsolidation Memory reconsolidation refers to the process in which a previously stored memory is reactivated, entering an unstable state and requiring reconsolidation to maintain its storage. This process allows for the modification or updating of existing memories to adapt to new information or contexts, potentially leading to memory enhancement, weakening, or distortion. Once a memory is reactivated, it involves the hippocampus and amygdala and may be influenced by emotions, cognitive biases, or new information, resulting in memory adjustment or reshaping.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Reflection Memory reflection refers to the process in which an individual actively reviews, evaluates, and examines their own memory content and processes to enhance self-awareness, adjust learning strategies, or optimize decision-making. It helps improve metacognitive ability, correct memory biases, facilitate deep learning, and regulate emotions. This process primarily relies on the brain’s metacognitive ability (Metacognition) and involves the prefrontal cortex, which monitors and regulates memory functions.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Forgetting Forgetting is a natural process that occurs when the brain fails to retrieve or retain information, which can result from encoding failure (when information is not properly encoded due to lack of attention or meaningful connection), memory decay (when memories fade over time without reinforcement as neural connections weaken), interference (when similar or new memories compete with or overwrite existing ones), retrieval failure (when information is inaccessible due to missing contextual cues despite being stored), or motivated forgetting (when individuals consciously suppress or unconsciously repress traumatic or distressing memories). However, forgetting is a natural and necessary process that enables our brains to filter out irrelevant and outdated information, allowing us to prioritize what is most important for our current needs.
