MemoryBank enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with a long-term memory system that allows for ongoing interactions and personalized responses.

The mechanism uses a model inspired by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve to selectively forget less important information while retaining significant memories, leading to improved user experience.
