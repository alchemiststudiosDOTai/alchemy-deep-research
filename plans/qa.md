# QA Findings & Resolution Report

This document outlines issues encountered during the execution and testing of the `research.ts` script, their resolutions, and feedback for improving dependent packages.

## 1. CLI Execution & Module Resolution Issues

### Issue 1.1: TypeScript Compilation Errors (TS2339, TS7053)

- **Description:** Initial execution of `npx ts-node research.ts ...` resulted in TypeScript errors like `Property 'query' does not exist on type 'Promise<...>'` and `Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '"openai-model"' can't be used to index type...`.
- **Root Cause:** The `yargs` argument parsing (`argv`) was not being `await`ed, causing the `argv` variable to be a Promise when its properties were accessed.
- **Resolution:**

  1.  The `argv` variable initialization was moved inside the `async function main()`.
  2.  The `await` keyword was added before the `yargs(...).argv` call in [`research.ts`](research.ts:13).

  ```typescript
  // research.ts - Before
  // const argv = yargs(...).argv;
  // async function main() {
  //   const result = await deepResearch(argv.query, ...);
  // }

  // research.ts - After
  async function main() {
    const argv = await yargs(process.argv.slice(2))
      // ... options ...
      .argv;
    const result = await deepResearch(argv.query, ...);
  }
  ```

### Issue 1.2: Module Not Found - `alchemy-deep-research`

- **Description:** After resolving the initial TypeScript errors, the script failed with `Error: Cannot find module '/root/Jasons Course/node_modules/alchemy-deep-research/dist/index.cjs'`.
- **Root Cause:** The project was configured as a CommonJS (CJS) module system, while the `alchemy-deep-research` package is an ES Module (ESM). Node.js was looking for a CJS entry point (`.cjs`) which doesn't exist for this ESM package.
- **Resolution:**
  1.  **Re-installed `alchemy-deep-research`:** Ensured the package was correctly installed (`npm uninstall alchemy-deep-research && npm install alchemy-deep-research`).
  2.  **Updated `tsconfig.json` for ESM:**
      - Set `"target": "es2022"` (from `"es2016"`)
      - Set `"module": "nodenext"` (from `"commonjs"`)
      - Set `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` (uncommented and changed from `"node10"`)
  3.  **Updated `package.json` for ESM:**
      - Added `"type": "module"` to designate the project as an ES Module project.

### Issue 1.3: `TypeError: Unknown file extension ".ts"`

- **Description:** After configuring the project for ESM, running `npx ts-node research.ts ...` resulted in `TypeError: Unknown file extension ".ts"`.
- **Root Cause:** When a project is in ESM mode, `ts-node` needs to be invoked via the Node.js `--loader` flag to correctly handle TypeScript files.
- **Resolution:** The execution command was changed to:
  ```bash
  node --loader ts-node/esm research.ts --query "..." --openai-model "..." ...
  ```

## 2. `alchemy-deep-research` Package Feedback (`BrowserUseClient`)

### Issue 2.1: Missing Prompt File & Failure to Generate Report

- **Description:** When the `research.ts` script programmatically calls functions from the `alchemy-deep-research` package (specifically those utilizing `BrowserUseClient`), it failed during execution with the error:
  `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/root/Jasons Course/node_modules/alchemy-deep-research/dist/../prompts/browser-use.md'`
  Additionally, when browser extraction failed (e.g., `[BROWSER] No extraction result for URL ...`), no report or raw data was saved.
- **Impact:** Critical information (web page content) is lost, and the research process is incomplete.
- **Recommendations for `alchemy-deep-research` Developers:**
  1.  **Ensure All Necessary Files are Packaged:** The `prompts/browser-use.md` file seems to be missing from the distributed package or is not being located correctly. Verify packaging and path resolution.
  2.  **Robust Error Handling & Reporting:**
      - The `BrowserUseClient` should **always** attempt to generate a report, even if parts of its process fail.
      - If a custom prompt is not found, it should fall back to a default prompt gracefully (as it seems to try to do) but also log a clear warning about the missing custom prompt.
      - If web content extraction fails for a URL, this failure should be explicitly noted in the output report for that URL.
  3.  **Persist Raw Data:**
      - It is highly recommended to save the raw content retrieved by tools like Firecrawl (or whatever underlying mechanism `BrowserUseClient` uses for fetching page content) to a file, for example, `raw_report.md` or `raw_content_[timestamp_or_url].md`. This provides a fallback and allows for manual inspection or reprocessing if automated extraction/digestion fails.
      - Even if the LLM-based extraction or summarization fails, having the raw HTML or Markdown content is valuable.
